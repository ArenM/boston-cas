%p These alternate matches list the clients who could be assigned to this housing opportunity. To choose the next client in the list, go to the Match in Progress and decline the match. A new match will be created with the person at the top of the list. In a future iteration, we could offer additional options here, such as to recommend one of these clients instead (automatically declining the existing match), or to decline all future matches for a specific person for this type of opportunity).
